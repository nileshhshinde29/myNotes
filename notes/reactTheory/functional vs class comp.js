/* 
Advantages of redux over Context API:
  - redux use concepts like immutability and memorization to optimize performance.
  - redux allows middleware to handle asynchronous operations. like redux thunk, redux saga. 
  - we can add add devtool integration for fixing bugs in complex applications.
  - redux have large community support.

 Context API:
    - its build in in react js. Don`t need to add additional dependencies.
    - best for small and mid size applications.
