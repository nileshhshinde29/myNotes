Thread Pool in Node.js
A thread pool is a group of worker threads separate from the main event loop thread Node.js uses to execute JavaScript code and handle requests. The underlying operating system manages these worker threads. They are used to perform certain types of tasks that can be slow and blocking, such as reading or writing to a file, performing cryptographic functions, etc. These tasks are known as blocking operations, and they can cause the event loop to pause execution, which can lead to poor performance. By offloading these tasks to the worker threads in the thread pool, it allows the event loop thread to continue handling other tasks without being blocked by the slow operations.

Imagine a scenario where you have a Node.js application that needs to read a large file from the file system and perform some calculations. Without the thread pool, the event loop thread would be blocked while the file is being read, leading to poor performance. But with the thread pool, the file reading task is offloaded to a worker thread, allowing the event loop thread to continue handling other requests while the file is being read.

The thread pool in Node.js is implemented using the libuv library. The libuv library provides an abstraction layer over the operating systemâ€™s I/O operations. Node.js use it to handle various I/O operations such as file system access, network communication and more. Libuv is platform-agnostic, which means it is designed to work seamlessly across different operating systems, such as Windows, Linux and macOS.

By default, libuv uses a thread pool with 4 threads, but this number can be changed by setting the UV_THREADPOOL_SIZEenvironment variable. This means that you can increase or decrease the number of threads in the thread pool depending on the requirements of your application.
