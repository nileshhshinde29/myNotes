Many people believe in superstitions, Some people think that certain things or actions can bring good or bad luck. There are so many superstitions that people follow. Many time we learn them from our parents and grandparents when we're young. But many of these beliefs don't really make sense, and they're not based on science.

Have you ever seen lemons and chillies tied together with a string at the entrance of shops or homes? People do this because they believe it can protect them from something called 'the evil eye.'
But there's a scientific reason behind it too. When you put lemons and chillies together on a string, it creates a mix of chemicals that can keep bugs and pests away. 

Our ancestors thought that sleeping with your head to the north could make you sick or even lead to death.
The reason behind this is that the Earth has a sort of magnetic force, like a giant invisible magnet. If you sleep with your head pointing north, it might cause problems with your body, like messing up your blood pressure. That's why they say it's better to sleep with your head facing south to avoid these issues. 

Sometimes, you might see people throwing coins into water and making wishes. A long time ago, coins were made of copper, which can clean water and make it safer to drink by killing things like germs.So, throwing copper coins into water was like wishing for good health.


It's important to understand which superstitions are just stories and which ones have a good reason behind them. We should encourage people to think logically and not blindly believe in things that don't make sense.
